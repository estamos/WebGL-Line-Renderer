# WebGL-Line-Renderer
The given task is to render a line in WebGL. 

## A few requirements:

1. You are NOT allowed to use any libraries. Vanilla javascript only.
2. The user should be able to configure the width (in pixels)
3. The user should be able to dynamically add more line segments to the existing line. I don't care about the interface, but some examples that I'd happily accept include (a) a button to generate a random coordinate to add to the line (b) a text input in which the user enters an x,y coordinate (c) clicking on the page and drawing a line to that point

Host this on a publicly accessible url. Bonus points if you style it nicely!
